# Board Game: Crime and Punishment (Working Title)

## Overview
The sovereign for life is dead. After his illustrious reign, great houses now look to profit from the chaos.

## Goal of the game
- Become the richest house. Cash still on characters at end of game may count (haven't decided yet)

## Rules

### Board:
- The board has spaces for a Sovereign, Heads of State, and 3 judges under each head of state
- The most senior judge is closes to the head of state
- At the bottom are slots for potential judges, for any group
- Each head of state and their judges are responsible for prosecuting a specific crime (called a department (?))
- Each department has a slot for the current fee, plus a slider for evidence required
- Space for the bank. The bank is _limited_ in cash

### Sovereign:
- If there is no character in the sovereign's position, the bank is used as the sovereign's vault
- If there is a character in the sovereign's position, that player's cash is the sovereign's vault
- If the sovereign's vault ever runs dry, the character in the sovereign's position is immediately removed

### Players:
- Each player has their own cash store
- Players may trade cash from their own stores to each other at any time (but not to characters)
- Each player has character cards to fill just under half the available slots on the board (no single majorities)

### Characters:
- Each character on the board belongs to a house (one of the players)
- Each character has its own cash store, separate to the players
- Cash can move from an owned character, to any other character (cash may not move from characters to players, except during retirement)

### Crimes:
- A deck of cards with crimes listed
- Houses start with 3 crime cards each, and can draw more
- As an action, crimes can be played on other players/characters
- Potential crimes:
-- Robbery: Take 3 coins from a character to another character for each robbery card played
-- Murder: Kill a character on the board. Their money goes to the bank. Needs 1 card for a potential judge, 2 for a judge, 3 for a head of state, and 4 for a sovereign
-- Embezzle: Take 2 coins from the sovereign's vault to a character. Cards are discarded if there is no sovereign

#### Influence
- Also in the crimes deck
- Used to cancel any card played

### Game start
- Going around the table, players place one character in any slot they wish
- All remaining characters are placed in the potential judges area

### Actions:
On a player's turn, they may take one action
- Commit a crime
-- Play any number of the same type of card and do the action
-- The more played at once, the more powerful the effect
-- Give the played cards to the player/character's owning player they were used on
- Begin a trial
-- Accuse a character of a crime
-- Anyone at the table may play crimes
-- Three evidence cards total are required to convict
-- If the conviction is successful:
--- The character suffers the consequnce (losing all cash on the character to the sovereign's vault, lose all cash and get sent to pending judges, death)
--- The appropriate head of state and judges are paid a fee by the sovereign depending on crime (1 for robbery, 2 for embezzlement, 4 for murder)
---- If the sovergein's vault would run dry, the head of state is first paid, then the most senior judge, then the next senior judge, etc
- Change a law
-- Start a vote to change a law. A majority vote is required to change the law.
-- (If the player is the sovereign, no vote is required)
-- Voting bloc depends on the law being changed
-- Laws:
--- Crime Fee: Swap the fee tokens for prosecuting a crime. Voting bloc: Sovereign and heads of state
--- Evidence requirement: By default crimes need 3 evidence cards. This can be changed from 2-4. Voting bloc: Head of state and judges. (Maybe not, it might break things)
- Appoint a sovereign:
-- Only doable if the sovereign slot is empty. Each head of state votes for a head of state. If no majority, the vote fails and play continues
- Appoint a head of state:
-- The sovereign may promote a judge to the empty head of state
- Appoint a judge:
-- A head of state may appoint a judge from the potential judges to one of their empty judge slots
- Appoint a potential judge
-- Add a character from outside the board to the potential judge area
- Retire a head of state:
-- As sovereign: remove a head of state from the board, putting all money on the character into their owner's vault
- Retire a judge:
-- As head of state, remove one of their judges from the board, putting all money on the character into their owner's vault
- Draw 3 crime cards

## Notes
- Retiring characters is the only
