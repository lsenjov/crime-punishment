# Board Game: Crime and Punishment (Working Title)

## Overview
The sovereign for life is dead. After his illustrious reign, great houses now look to profit from the chaos.

## Goal of the game
- Become the richest house. Cash still on characters at end of game may count (haven't decided yet)

## Rules

### Board:
- The board has spaces for a Sovereign, Heads of State, and 3 judges under each head of state
- The most senior judge is closes to the head of state
- At the bottom are slots for potential judges, for any group
- Each head of state and their judges are responsible for prosecuting a specific crime (called a department (?))
- Each department has a slot for the current fee, plus a slider for evidence required

### Sovereign:
- If there is no character in the sovereign's position, a vote immediately takes place, choosing among current heads of state.
-- If tied, the richest is sovereign
-- If still tied, the furtherest to the right is promoted
- If there is a character in the sovereign's position, that player's cash is the sovereign's vault
- If the sovereign's vault ever runs dry, the character in the sovereign's position is immediately removed

### Head of state:
- If a head of state is empty, the most senior judge immediately takes the position

### Players:
- Each player has their own cash store
- Players may trade cash from their own stores to each other at any time (but not to characters)
- Each player has character cards to fill just under half the available slots on the board (no single majorities)

### Characters:
- Each character on the board belongs to a house (one of the players)
- Each character has its own cash store, separate to the players

### Crimes:
- A deck of cards with crimes listed
- Houses start with 3 crime cards each, and can draw more
- As an action, crimes can be played on other players/characters
- Other players can add in more cards to make the effect more powerful
- Potential crimes:
-- Robbery: Take 3 coins from a character to another character for each robbery card played
-- Murder: Kill a character on the board. Needs 2 cards for a judge, 3 for a head of state, and 4 for a sovereign
-- Embezzle: Take 2 coins from the sovereign's vault to a character.

### Game start
- Going around the table, players place one character in any slot they wish
- All remaining characters are placed in the potential judges area

### Turn start
- If a player has less than 5 cards, draw up to 5 cards

### Actions:
On a player's turn, they may take one action
- Commit a crime
-- Play any number of the same type of card and do the action
-- The more played at once, the more powerful the effect
-- Give the played cards to the player/character's owning player they were used on
- Begin a trial
-- Accuse a character of a crime
-- Anyone at the table may play crimes
-- Evidence cards total to the "evidence required" slider are required to convict
-- If the conviction is successful:
--- The character loses all cash to the sovereign, and is killed
--- The appropriate head of state and judges are paid a fee by the sovereign depending on crime (equal to the amount on the slider)
---- If the sovergein's vault would run dry, the head of state is first paid, then the most senior judge, then the next senior judge, etc
- Appoint a judge:
-- A head of state may appoint any number of judges from the potential judges to one of their empty judge slots
-- A house may appoint one judge from their house to any single empty judge slot

### When a character becomes sovereign
- The owning player may increase one "Required Evidence" slider by one, and decrease another by one.
- The owning player may increase one "Conviction Payment" slider by one, and decrease another by one.
